# 🎓 Analyzing Student Stress Factors

## 🧠 Overview

The **Student Stress Factors** project explores the many sources and levels of stress experienced by students. The dataset captures both academic and personal influences, aiming to understand how different elements affect students’ mental and emotional well-being.  

Each record represents an individual student and includes details such as:
- Study habits and workload  
- Exam pressure and performance  
- Relationships and social interactions  
- Sleep quality and health symptoms  
- Participation in extracurricular activities  

The overall goal is to **identify key contributors to student stress** and provide insights that can guide well-being and academic support initiatives.

## 🧩 Project Structure

### 1. Importing Libraries
The project begins with importing essential Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. These tools are used to explore and interpret relationships within the dataset.

### 2. Importing the Dataset
The dataset is then loaded into the analysis environment for review. It forms the foundation for subsequent data exploration, visualization, and interpretation.

### 3. Checking Columns of the Dataset
A review of all available columns is performed to understand the features included in the dataset. This helps identify which variables relate to academic, personal, and lifestyle factors.

## 📊 Describing the Dataset

A summary of the dataset’s structure and statistics provides an overview of:
- The total number of records (students)
- The range of stress levels and related variables
- Central tendencies and variability across the dataset  

This descriptive step helps set the foundation for further insights.

## 🧾 Checking Information About the Dataset

Before deep analysis, general information about the dataset is reviewed — such as data types, missing values, and completeness.  

### Checking the Shape of the Dataset
The shape (number of rows and columns) is noted to understand the dataset’s size and complexity.  

### Checking for Null Values
It is important to verify whether any features contain missing or null data that could influence the accuracy of the analysis. Handling such values ensures reliable results.

## 🧮 Key Analytical Questions

The following questions guide the analysis and visualization process:

1. **Is there a relationship between sleep quality and students’ attention levels?**  
   Explore whether students with better sleep quality tend to maintain higher focus and attentiveness.

2. **Are frequent headaches related to high stress levels?**  
   Assess if physical symptoms such as headaches correspond with reported stress levels.

3. **Does study load affect stress levels?**  
   Analyze whether the volume of academic work contributes significantly to stress.

4. **Do extracurricular activities reduce stress?**  
   Examine if involvement in hobbies or non-academic activities helps alleviate stress.

5. **Is high academic performance linked to lower stress?**  
   Investigate if top-performing students experience lower stress or if high achievement correlates with higher pressure.
